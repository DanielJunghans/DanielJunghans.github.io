I am a second year finance student at Michigan State University's [Broad College of Business](https://broad.msu.edu/). My current interests are in machine learning, securities research, and portfolio management. 

While attending Michigan State University, I have learned about machine learning and artificial neural networks(ANN) through my work as a research assistant. I am currently working in the [National Science Foundation's BEACON Center for the Study of Evolution in Action](https://www3.beacon-center.org/) under the supervision of Dr. Charles Ofria. Researching machine learning/ANNs has changed my perception of financial analysis and ignited my passion for researching securities.
