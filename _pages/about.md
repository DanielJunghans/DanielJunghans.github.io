I am a fourth year finance student at Michigan State University's  [Eli Broad College of Business](https://broad.msu.edu/). I am a knowledgeable young finance professional eager to leverage my understanding of finance to generate creative solutions. Interests include finance, banking, and data analytics. Special interest in developing financial models that will guide management teams towards the most advantageous decisions. Skilled in Microsoft Office applications, Python 3, SQL, R, Tableau, and PowerBI. 

I've developed a working knowledge of machine learning and artificial neural networks through my work as a research assistant in the [National Science Foundation's BEACON Center for the Study of Evolution in Action](https://www3.beacon-center.org/) under the supervision of Dr. Charles Ofria.
